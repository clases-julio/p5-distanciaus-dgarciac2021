# P5-DistanceUS

This exercise consists on drive two [LED's](https://github.com/clases-julio/p1-introrpi-pwm-dgarciac2021/wiki/LED) through [GPIO](https://github.com/clases-julio/p1-introrpi-pwm-dgarciac2021/wiki/GPIO) available on the [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://github.com/clases-julio/p1-introrpi-pwm-dgarciac2021/wiki/Raspberry-Pi#raspberry-pi-3b) and the help of two buttons. You might want to take a look on the wiki, since there is info of everything involved on this project. From the [button](https://github.com/clases-julio/p3-interruptions-dgarciac2021/wiki/Button) to the [interrupt procedure](https://github.com/clases-julio/p3-interruptions-dgarciac2021/wiki/Interrupt).

## Circuit Assembly

This time the assembly gets a little bit more complex. We are using two buttons, two LED's and two 220Î©[^1] resistors.

This is an schematic made with [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/):

And this is the real circuit!

## Code

We would like to highlight some remarkable aspects from our code.

In [e1](./src/e1/interrupcionEdgeBueno.py), we found that there is more parameters for `GPIO.wait_for_edge` that we saw in the exercise guide. More on them [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Inputs/). More precisely, we focused on `timeout`, which is a parameter that sets the time (in ms) which the `GPIO.wait_for_edge` *will actually wait for that edge*. If that time expires, a `None` is returned, whereas an edge is detected on time, any number is returned.

```python3
state = GPIO.wait_for_edge(pulsadorGPIO, GPIO.RISING, bouncetime=50, timeout=100)
if state is not None: print("El boton se ha pulsado")
```

This turned out to be very handy to solve a lot of problems with our code.

Secondly, for [e2](./src/e2), we took advantage of [python lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) behaviour in order to make an scalable code. Enssentially, [GPIO](https://github.com/clases-julio/p1-introrpi-pwm-dgarciac2021/wiki/GPIO) ports in a `python` script are just numbers, thus we can operate with them.

```python3
buttons = [button1, button2]
leds = [led1, led2]

for button in buttons:
    GPIO.setup(button, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
for led in leds:
    GPIO.setup(led, GPIO.OUT)
```

This means that we can iterate over a list of GPIO's to use them on whatever function we need, like setting up [pull up resistors](https://github.com/clases-julio/p3-interruptions-dgarciac2021/wiki/Pull-Up-Down) on each pin or the GPIO mode.

We noticed that [`sinInterrupcionesMejorado.py`](./src/e2/sinInterrupcionesMejorado.py) actually works as a normally wired LED throughout a push button. Sure we could not modify its behaviour with just a few keystrokes, but maybe sometimes is easier to use the K.I.S.S.[^2] method! Which should be a *mantra* in our engineers life, *BTW*.

Joking apart, just assign the opposite read of the button will do the job.

```python3
def driveLed(led, state):
    GPIO.output(led, state)
    return None

driveLed(led, not checkButton(button)) # Inverted Logic
```

[`InterrupcionEdgeMejorado.py`](./src/e2/InterrupcionEdgeMejorado.py) was the most difficult implementation since the program will actually wait without doing nothing else. Fortunately for us, we discover the `timeout` parameter.

After tweaking the `timeout` parameter along with a `time.sleep` needed to catch the `KeyboardInterrupt` event, we concluded that a value of 75-100ms for the first and 0.05-0.1ms for the second is the most suitable for this application. However this procedure is not the best and some presses might be missed.

The main problem is, ironically, also the `timeout` parameter. With this implementation the program waits for 75-100ms + 0.05-0.1ms **for each button/led**. With more of this componentes added to the circuit, this program would not be viable. 

Finally, in [`InterrupcionEventMejorado.py`](./src/e2/InterrupcionEventMejorado.py) we found that the argument that the `callbackFunction` takes is actually the GPIO number where the event was detected. Awesome!

Based on that, we can easily drive the correct LED on every event detected. We also added a loop to set up all events on each GPIO.

```python3
for button in buttons:
    GPIO.add_event_detect(button, GPIO.BOTH, callback=callbackButton, bouncetime=100)

```

## Circuit testing

This is the result! Pretty nice, isn't it?

Actually, the behaviour is the same in all the implementations.

[^1]: As we saw in previous exercises, this resistor value might be too high for the 3V3 that the RPI GPIO provides. The only issue is that the LED's will be dimmer.
